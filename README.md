**About this project:**

This simple web application hosts a messaging board where a user can create / sign in to an account and post anonymous messages. If the user can solve a riddle, they are allowed to see the author of written messages. There is also an admin account that can delete messages. 

To view project functionality without creating an account, here are two accounts for use:
user: guest
password: user12345 

And the administrator account details:
user: admin
password: aaaaxxxx


**Frameworks**
This project was built using Node/Express, Passport, Mongoose, MongoDB and the Pug templating engine.

**Takeaways**
This project gave me a chance to get more familiar with user authentication, password encryption and session management. Being new to Express, it also gave me some more practice with the model-view-controller design paradigm.
